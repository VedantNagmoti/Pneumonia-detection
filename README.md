Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-ray Images
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia in patients using deep learning techniques applied to chest X-ray images. The goal is to develop an automated system that accurately classifies X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia, helping healthcare professionals in diagnosing the condition efficiently.

Project Overview
Pneumonia is a serious infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, causing a significant health burden worldwide. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing severe complications. This machine learning model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify X-ray images, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce human error.

Features
Model: Built using a CNN architecture to efficiently extract features from X-ray images and classify them.
Dataset: Utilizes a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images containing both normal and pneumonia cases.
Training & Testing: Includes model training, validation, and testing with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Displays model results and evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and training/validation curves.
Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Chest X-ray Dataset, which contains thousands of labeled X-ray images categorized into normal and pneumonia cases.

Model Architecture
The model utilizes a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers, ReLU activation, and max-pooling. A fully connected layer is used at the end for classification.
